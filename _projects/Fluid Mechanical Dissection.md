For a class, we were asked to dissect a mechanical design. The design was a humidifier.

In this humidifier dissection, we discuss the breakdown of fluid mechanical flow from component to component throughout the inner workings of the device. Members of the group describe the flow of tiny water droplets in the system as they are influenced by reservoirs, pumps, and fans.
