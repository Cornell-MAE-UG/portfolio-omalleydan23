For a class, we were asked to dissect a mechanical design. The design was a Sphero SPRK+ Robot.

In addition to this, we made a 10 page report discussing ODE derivations, the transfer functions, battery model, block diagram, and plots. My part was to model the robot's transfer functions and block diagram of the feedback loops, mapping user and voltage input to currents, angular velocities, and linear motion. These transfer functions provide the groundwork for a robust block diagram that dives into the control loops, state estimator, and sensors that make the sphero bot come to life.
