On the Cornell Baja SAE team this year, I was responsible for the design, validation, machining, and testing of our custom master cylinders, the driving force of our brakes system. The master cylinder design for TG21 (our newest car) is rooted in reliability and optimal performance, building off design choices of many previous Baja cars. The design work, completed in SolidWorks, required careful consideration for proper seal specification dimensions, pressure based factors of safety (FEA conducted in ANSYS), and sufficient force output based on our mechanical advantage, bore size, and fluid displacement.

At our first competition of the 2024–2025 season, TG21's brakes system passed brake check on the first attempt, and then went on to remain intact and functional throughout the entire four hour endurance race, a feat that was not achieved on our previous year's car, TGXX. With the help of this system, TG21 went on to achieve each of the top five fastest lap times and win 1st place overall at Baja SAE Arizona 2025.

Machining the master cylinders was simplified by thorough DFMA conducted during the preliminary, critical, and final design stages, which was ultimately finazlized during our manufacturing design review. Each machined component in this design was able to be made in-house on either our Tormach or HAAS CNC mills, as well as Trak CNC lathes. This provided the valuable experience of machining the components I designed, understanding which drawing dimensions are important, and ensuring that each component is within tolerance so that they can interface properly and still be assembled and function as intended.

Upon manufacturing and assembling the master cylinders, custom calipers, rotors, brake pedal, brake lines, and other small parts, we set up a testing rig to pressurize the system and identify any potential issues. This rid was then used for alternate master cylinder testing that could be conducted including varying external spring lengths and stiffnesses, spacer pre-load for optimal retraction, and differing bias spacer lengths to adjust the balance bar and change our systems front/rear bias.
