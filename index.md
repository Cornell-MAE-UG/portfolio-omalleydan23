## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Headshot_smaller.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a sophomore mechanical engineering student at Cornell University with a strong interest in automotive and aerospace design, testing, and manufacturing. As a member of the Cornell Baja SAE team, I’ve found a passion for hands-on, technical engineering work — from designing and machining custom brake system components to assembling a custom dynamometer for testing. My time on the Baja racing team has given me real-world experience in CAD design, CNC/manual machining, design validation/testing and collaborative problem-solving in a fast-paced project environment.

Outside the classroom, I’ve gained industry experience through engineering internships at Fabreeka International, where I focused on thermal break material redesign using FEA, and an upcoming Manufacturing Quality Engineering Internship at Schneider Electric. At Cornell, I stay engaged as a varsity athlete on the Sprint Football team, a member of the Big Red Leaders 2 Leaders program, and the Cornell Catholic community — balancing academics with leadership, athletics, and personal growth.
